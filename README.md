# classifier

Please refere to sveltos [documentation](https://projectsveltos.github.io/sveltos/).

Sveltos Classifier is an componet of the Sveltos project and it is used to dynamically classify a cluster based on its runtime configuration (Kubernetes version, deployed resources and more).

Classifier currently supports the following classification criteria:
1. Kubernetes version
2. Kubernetes resources

For instance, this Classifier instance will match any cluster whose Kubernetes version is greater than or equal to "v1.24.0" and strictly less than "v1.25.2"

```
apiVersion: lib.projectsveltos.io/v1beta1
kind: Classifier
metadata:
  name: kubernetes-v1.24
spec:
  classifierLabels:
  - key: k8s-version
    value: v1.24
  kubernetesVersionConstraints:
  - comparison: GreaterThanOrEqualTo
    version: 1.24.0
  - comparison: LessThan
    version: 1.25.2
```

When a cluster is a match for a Classifier instances, all classifierLabels will be automatically added to the Cluster instance.

Refer to [examples](./examples/) for more complex examples.

## A simple use case: upgrade helm charts automatically when Kubernetes cluster is upgraded
Suppose you are managing several Kubernetes clusters with different versions.
And you want to deploy:
1. OPA Gatekeeper version 3.10.0 in any Kubernetes cluster whose version is >= v1.25.2
2. OPA Gatekeeper version 3.9.0 in any Kubernetes cluster whose version is >= v1.24.0 && < v1.25.2

You can create following ClusterProfiles and Classifiers in the management cluster:
```
apiVersion: config.projectsveltos.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterProfile
metadata:
  name: deploy-gatekeeper-3-10
spec:
  clusterSelector:
    matchLabels:
      gatekeeper: v3-10
  syncMode: Continuous
  helmCharts:
  - repositoryURL: https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/charts
    repositoryName: gatekeeper
    chartName: gatekeeper/gatekeeper
    chartVersion:  3.10.0
    releaseName: gatekeeper
    releaseNamespace: gatekeeper
    helmChartAction: Install
```

```
apiVersion: config.projectsveltos.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterProfile
metadata:
  name: deploy-gatekeeper-3-9
spec:
  clusterSelector:
    matchLabels:
      gatekeeper: v3-9
  syncMode: Continuous
  helmCharts:
  - repositoryURL: https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/charts
    repositoryName: gatekeeper
    chartName: gatekeeper/gatekeeper
    chartVersion:  3.9.0
    releaseName: gatekeeper
    releaseNamespace: gatekeeper
    helmChartAction: Install
```

Then create following Classifiers

```
apiVersion: lib.projectsveltos.io/v1beta1
kind: Classifier
metadata:
  name: deploy-gatekeeper-3-10
spec:
  classifierLabels:
  - key: gatekeeper
    value: v3-10
  kubernetesVersionConstraints:
  - comparison: GreaterThanOrEqualTo
    version: 1.25.2
```

```
apiVersion: lib.projectsveltos.io/v1beta1
kind: Classifier
metadata:
  name: deploy-gatekeeper-3-9
spec:
  classifierLabels:
  - key: gatekeeper
    value: v3-9
  kubernetesVersionConstraints:
  - comparison: GreaterThanOrEqualTo
    version: 1.24.0
  - comparison: LessThan
    version: 1.25.2
```

With the above configuration:
1. Any cluster with a Kubernetes version v1.24.x will get label _gatekeeper:v3.9_ added and because of that Gatekeeper 3.9.0 helm chart will be deployed;
2. Any cluster with a Kubernetes version v1.25.x will get label _gatekeeper:v3.10_ added and because of that Gatekeeper 3.10.0 helm chart will be deployed;
3. As soon a cluster is upgraded from Kubernetes version v1.24.x to v1.25.x, Gatekeeper helm chart will be automatically upgraded from 3.9.0 to 3.10.0
